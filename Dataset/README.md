# Dataset

### 1. Dataset format
We provide two formats of our StepGame dataset, which are completely the same except the file format.

`babi_format` is  used for baselines models in the our paper.
`json_format` is in a clearer format.

### 2. Generate more samples
```
python parameterized_step_game_8relation.py --seed 123
```
